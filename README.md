As the world shifts more towards tech, so does the evolution of job postings and the hiring process. 20 years ago, you may have needed to purchase a newspaper or go business to business with a resume to apply for positions but today we conveniently have online job boards such as LinkedIn, indeed, Zip Recruiter and many other online platforms. These platforms host hundreds of thousands of job postings available to users every day, but with so many postings it's impossible to individually vet every poster and ensure that they are legitimate. With convivences such as one tap apply or quick apply it's even easier to slip past the user's radar with an illegitimate job scam.  

For this reason, it's important to do your due diligence before providing too much personal information to a potential employer. To avoid scams I recommend using many of the skills we use to identify phishing scams in our email inboxes.  

Remember jobs will never ask you for your banking information, to make a payment directly to them, or for a great deal of personal information such as “mother's maiden name” if a job offer has not even been accepted. While a job with an illustrious pay that is way higher than the industry average might seem promising it's good to recognize this as a red flag.  

Even with the most legitimate job offers, we should always make sure to check the sender's email address. If they reach out on a site like LinkedIn you can examine their connections and check the company that made the post. You can also use google and sites like reddit to see if a suspected scam may have been identified by others.</div>
